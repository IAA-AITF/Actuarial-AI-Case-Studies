# Actuarial AI Case Studies

Welcome to the **Actuarial AI Case Studies** repository, an initiative of the International Actuarial Association (IAA). This repository curates real-world case studies demonstrating the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in actuarial work.

## üîç Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide actuaries with practical insights into how AI‚Äîencompassing machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and more‚Äîcan be leveraged in actuarial science. By showcasing these applications, we aim to support actuaries in integrating AI-driven solutions into their practice.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

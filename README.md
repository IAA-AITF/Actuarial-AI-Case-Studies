# Actuarial AI Case Studies

Welcome to the **Actuarial AI Case Studies** repository, created as part of the International Actuarial Association's (IAA) Task Force on Artificial Intelligence. This repository supports the Task Force's objective to curate and share practical applications of AI in actuarial work.

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide actuaries with practical insights through case studies that demonstrate how AI‚Äîencompassing machine learning, generative AI, agentic AI, and more‚Äîcan be integrated into actuarial science practices. By showcasing these applications, we aim to support actuaries in adopting AI-driven solutions in their professional practice.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **case-studies/**  
  A collection of case studies illustrating AI case studies in actuarial contexts, including topics such as risk modeling, pricing, forecasting, and claims analysis.

- **templates/**  
  Templates for creating new AI case studies. Detailed instructions on how to hand in your case study contributions are provided in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from actuaries, data scientists, and AI practitioners. Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details on how to submit your case studies. Alternatively, you can also [contact us via email](mailto:simon.hatzesberger@gmail.com) for any questions or suggestions.
